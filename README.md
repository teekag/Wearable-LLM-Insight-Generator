## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.insight_engine import InsightEngine, UserConfig, InsightType

# Initialize the insight engine
engine = InsightEngine()

# Define user configuration
user_config = UserConfig(
    persona="athlete",
    goals=["Improve endurance", "Better recovery"],
    preferences={"user_id": "user123"}
)

# Generate insights from data
insights = engine.generate_insight(
    data="data/unified/sample_athlete_data.json",
    user_config=user_config,
    insight_types=[
        InsightType(category="recovery", priority=1),
        InsightType(category="training", priority=2)
    ],
    data_format="json"
)

# Display insights
for insight in insights:
    print(f"Category: {insight.insight_type.category}")
    print(f"Summary: {insight.summary}")
    print(f"Detail: {insight.detail}")
    print(f"Recommendations:")
    for rec in insight.recommendations:
        print(f"- {rec}")
    print()
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Generate insights via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-insight \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user123",
    "persona": "athlete",
    "goals": ["Improve endurance", "Better recovery"],
    "insight_categories": ["recovery", "training", "sleep"]
