# Wearable Data Insight Generator

A modular AI system that ingests raw time-series data from wearables and generates personalized insights using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Overview

This project aims to transform raw physiological data from wearable devices into actionable insights using LLMs. The system processes time-series data (glucose levels, insulin doses, heart rate variability, sleep metrics, activity data, etc.), extracts meaningful features, and generates personalized recommendations based on user goals and physiological patterns.

This system was built and validated on the publicly available DiaTrend dataset, containing real wearable data from individuals managing Type 1 diabetes. While the system is designed to be flexible for various wearable data types, it has been specifically optimized for glucose management and diabetes-related insights.

## Model Architecture

The Wearable Data Insight Generator uses a hybrid architecture combining feature engineering and LLM fine-tuning:

### Base Model Selection
- **Foundation Model**: Mistral 7B (selected for its strong performance on biomedical tasks)
- **Adaptation Method**: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- **Context Window**: Extended to handle up to 7 days of time-series data with annotations

### Fine-Tuning Approach
- **Training Strategy**: Two-phase fine-tuning process
  1. Domain adaptation on medical literature and wearable device documentation
  2. Task-specific fine-tuning on annotated wearable data with expert insights
- **LoRA Configuration**:
  - Rank: 8
  - Alpha: 16
  - Target modules: q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj
  - Dropout: 0.05
- **Training Framework**: PyTorch with HuggingFace Transformers and PEFT libraries

### Input Processing
- Time-series data is processed through a feature extraction pipeline
- Features are normalized and formatted into structured prompts
- Temporal patterns are encoded using specialized tokens and positional markers

### Output Generation
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced between creativity and factual accuracy)
- Top-p sampling: 0.9
- Response format: JSON-structured insights with confidence scores

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Load and normalize data from various wearable devices (CSV, JSON formats)
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features from raw physiological data
  - Glucose volatility and time-in-range metrics
  - Pre/post-meal glucose response patterns
  - Total daily insulin and dosing patterns
  - Comment sentiment and tag analysis
- **Prompt Engineering**: Generate structured prompts for LLMs based on physiological inputs
- **LLM Integration**: Generate insights using OpenAI, Mistral, or Gemini APIs
- **Conversational Agent**: Interactive coaching based on wearable data and user goals
- **Web Interface**: FastAPI backend with interactive dashboard

## Training Pipeline

The training pipeline consists of several stages designed to efficiently fine-tune the model for wearable data interpretation:

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Dataset Collection**: Combination of DiaTrend data and synthetic wearable data
- **Annotation Process**: Expert-annotated insights and recommendations for training examples
- **Data Augmentation**: Time-shifting, noise addition, and pattern modification techniques

### 2. Domain Adaptation
- **Corpus Selection**: Medical literature, exercise physiology texts, and wearable device documentation
- **Pre-training Objective**: Masked language modeling with domain-specific vocabulary
- **Training Duration**: 3 epochs on domain corpus (approximately 10,000 documents)

### 3. Task-Specific Fine-Tuning
- **Training Data**: 5,000 annotated wearable data examples with expert insights
- **Fine-Tuning Method**: LoRA with 8-bit quantization for efficiency
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning rate: 2e-4 with cosine decay
  - Batch size: 8
  - Gradient accumulation steps: 4
  - Training epochs: 5

### 4. Evaluation and Iteration
- Continuous evaluation on held-out test set
- Human-in-the-loop feedback integration
- Progressive model versioning with performance tracking
