    "This week, your glucose management showed {\"strong\" if time_in_range > 70 else \"moderate\"} results with an average time in range of {time_in_range:.1f}% and an average glucose of {avg_glucose:.1f} mg/dL. You experienced about {hypo_events:.1f} hypoglycemic events per day, which {\"is within a reasonable range\" if hypo_events < 1 else \"suggests we should focus on reducing lows\"}.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Patterns Observed\n",
    "- Your glucose variability (standard deviation of {weekly_avg.get('glucose_std', 40):.1f} mg/dL) {\"is within target range\" if weekly_avg.get('glucose_std', 40) < 50 else \"indicates opportunities to smooth glucose curves\"}\n",
    "- Your daily insulin needs averaged {weekly_avg.get('total_daily_insulin', 40):.1f} units\n",
    "- Post-meal glucose rises appear to be a significant contributor to time spent above range\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Next Week\n",
    "1. Consider pre-bolusing insulin 15-20 minutes before meals to better match carbohydrate absorption\n",
    "2. Track the relationship between exercise and glucose levels more closely to optimize activity timing\n",
    "3. Review overnight basal rates/doses as morning glucose patterns suggest potential for optimization\n",

    "## Celebrate These Wins!\n",

    "- Your {\"limited hypoglycemic events\" if hypo_events < 1 else \"proactive management of glucose levels\"} shows your attention to safety\n",
